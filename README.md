# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

A Python-based project that tracks and visualizes global COVID-19 data using public datasets.  
This project was developed as part of the Python Development Module final submission.

---

## üéØ Objectives
- Collect global COVID-19 data from open sources
- Perform basic data cleaning and transformation
- Visualize the spread of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations
- Gain insights from trends across countries and continents

---

Example Visualizations

Global COVID-19 trend over time (cases & deaths)

Top 10 countries by total cases and deaths

Vaccination progress worldwide

Comparison of continents in terms of pandemic impact

Insights & Reflections

The pandemic evolved differently across regions, with varying peaks and waves.

Vaccination rollout significantly impacted the decline of severe cases and deaths.

This project improved my understanding of:

Working with real-world datasets

Cleaning and preparing large data in Python

Building meaningful and interactive visualizations
