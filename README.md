COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

A Python-based project that tracks and visualizes global COVID-19 data using public datasets.
This project was developed as part of the Python Development Module final submission.

 Objectives

Collect global COVID-19 data from open sources

Perform basic data cleaning and transformation

Visualize the spread of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations

Gain insights from trends across countries and continents

🛠 Tools & Libraries Used

Python 3.10

Pandas – data manipulation

Matplotlib – visualizations

Seaborn – statistical plots

Plotly – interactive charts

Requests – fetching data

 How to Run the Project

git clone https://github.com/your-username/covid19-global-tracker.git


Navigate into the project folder:

cd covid19-global-tracker


Install required libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Launch Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook


Open and run the notebook file:

COVID-19_Tracker.ipynb

 Example Visualizations

Global COVID-19 trend over time (cases & deaths)

Top 10 countries by total cases and deaths

Vaccination progress worldwide

Comparison of continents in terms of pandemic impact

 Insights & Reflections

The pandemic evolved differently across regions, with varying peaks and waves.

Vaccination rollout significantly impacted the decline of severe cases and deaths.

This project improved my understanding of:

Working with real-world datasets

Cleaning and preparing large data in Python

Building meaningful and interactive visualizations
